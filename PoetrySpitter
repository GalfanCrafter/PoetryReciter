European revolter! revoltress!\nFor till all ceases, neither must you cease.\n\nI do not know what you are for,(I do not know what I am for myself, nor what anything is for,)\nBut I will search carefully for it even in being foil'd,\nIn defeat, poverty, misconception, imprisonment--for they too are great.\n\nRevolt! and the bullet for tyrants!\nDid we think victory greta?\nSo it is--But now it seems to me, when it cannot be help'd, that defeat is great,\nAnd that death and dismay are great.";
